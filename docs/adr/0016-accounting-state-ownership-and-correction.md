# Restrict accounting state ownership and support explicit traffic correction

Only the periodic accounting reset task and an explicit administrator correction command may write accounting state. Normal traffic/status reads and Subscription requests remain read-only. A direction-aware correction may set RX and TX independently; a total-only correction is stored as a signed adjustment, can lower the reported total (including to zero), and must not fabricate directional counter values. Future counter deltas accumulate on top of the corrected total. Before a future first Anchored-month reset, the deployment creates the current schedule-aligned period and reports live usage; the first reset caps that initial period.

This keeps HTTP request handling from mutating monthly state while preserving the operational ability to repair an incorrect starting value or recover historical usage after a counter reset.
