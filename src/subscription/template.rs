//! The compile-time client content templates (ADR-0022).
//!
//! A [`ClientTemplate`] selects a [`TemplateSpec`]: the structural content a
//! full client artifact carries (proxy groups, rule sets, inline rules, DNS,
//! sniffing and the final group). The catalog is compiled in, never a file on
//! disk, so a malformed administrator paste cannot take down the default
//! subscription. `Standard` reproduces the pre-template output byte-for-byte —
//! the artifact goldens in `src/subscription/snapshots/` are the proof.
//!
//! `Global` and `Split` are the richer catalogs the axis exists for: eight
//! declared policy groups instead of three (seven for sing-box, which has no
//! failover outbound type), eight or nine external rule-sets instead of four,
//! and one inline routing rule per verdict. Every rule-set entry carries an
//! inline twin (see [`InlineRule::minimal_twin`]) rendered from the compiled-in
//! lists below, so `client_rule_profile = "minimal"` keeps making the same
//! routing *decisions* while never naming a rule CDN — that is the regression
//! ADR-0022 closes.
//!
//! The two templates differ where the owner's spec says they must:
//!
//! - `Global` is proxy-oriented. Only private/LAN destinations get a direct
//!   verdict; the CN rule-set is routed to a dedicated proxy group instead of
//!   direct, and DNS asks no rule-set which domains to resolve directly.
//! - `Split` is split-routing oriented. CN domains and CN addresses go direct,
//!   ads are rejected, and the remaining traffic is proxied.
//!
//! Neither changes the node list: `subscription-sing-box.json`, `uri`,
//! `subscription-base64-uri.txt` and `subscription-shadowrocket.txt` stay
//! byte-identical across all three templates (ADR-0022, and the test
//! `the_node_list_artifacts_are_byte_identical_across_templates`).
